## App Description:
The app shop is a simple e-commerce app that allows users to browse and purchase products. The app is built using Flutter and utilizes multiple providers to manage different parts of the app's state.

## Main Screen:
The app's main screen features a grid of products that users can scroll through and select. When a user selects a product, they are taken to a product details screen where they can see more information about the product and add it to their cart.

## Drawer:
The app includes a drawer that can be accessed by swiping from the left side of the screen. The drawer includes links to different parts of the app, such as the user's account page, their cart, and a settings page. The drawer is managed by a separate provider that handles the drawer's state.

## Cart Management:
When a user adds a product to their cart, the cart icon in the drawer is updated to show the number of items in the cart. The cart is managed by a separate provider that keeps track of the products in the cart and updates the cart icon in the drawer.

## 3D Viewer:
Finally, the app includes a viewer that allows users to see a 3D model of the product before they purchase it. The viewer is managed by a separate provider that handles the state of the viewer and allows users to interact with the 3D model.

## Overall State Management:
All of the app's state is managed using providers, which allows for easy and efficient state management. The app is designed to be flexible and customizable, making it easy to add new features and functionality.
