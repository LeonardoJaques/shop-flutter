## Description

The app shop is a simple e-commerce app that allows users to browse and purchase
products. The app is built using Flutter and utilizes multiple providers to
manage different parts of the app's state.

## Main Screen

The app's main screen features a grid of products that users can scroll through
and select. When a user selects a product, they are taken to a product details
screen where they can see more information about the product and add it to their
cart.

## Drawer

The app includes a drawer that can be accessed by swiping from the left side of
the screen. The drawer includes links to different parts of the app, such as the
user's account page, their cart, and a settings page. The drawer is managed by a
separate provider that handles the drawer's state.

## Cart Management

When a user adds a product to their cart, the cart icon in the drawer is updated
to show the number of items in the cart. The cart is managed by a separate
provider that keeps track of the products in the cart and updates the cart icon
in the drawer.

## 3D Viewer

Finally, the app includes a viewer that allows users to see a 3D model of the
product before they purchase it. The viewer is managed by a separate provider
that handles the state of the viewer and allows users to interact with the 3D
model.

## Overall State Management

All of the app's state is managed using providers, which allows for easy and
efficient state management. The app is designed to be flexible and customizable,
making it easy to add new features and functionality.
